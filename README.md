This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing root-solving techniques for mathematical equations and visualizing results.
The notebook focuses on solving roots of polynomial and transcendental equations using Python libraries such as sympy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and interactive visualizations with plotly.

Key Features:
        Solving roots of equations of 2nd-order polynomials.
        Symbolic solutions using sympy for exact roots.
        Interactive visualizations with plotly.
        Custom visualizations with zoomed-in regions using matplotlib.
