This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing root-solving techniques for mathematical equations and visualizing results.
The notebook focuses on solving roots of polynomial and transcendental equations using Python libraries such as sympy, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and interactive visualizations with plotly.

Key Features:
        Solving roots of equations of 2nd-order polynomials.
        Symbolic solutions using sympy for exact roots.
        Interactive visualizations with plotly.
        Custom visualizations with zoomed-in regions using matplotlib.

Varied L:
Examines solutions under varying parameter L.
Visualizes how changes in L influence the roots.

Varied Density for L = 10^3
Investigates solutions for fixed L = 10^3 while varying the density parameter.
Provides comparative visualizations.

Varied τm
Solves equations under varying τm (time constant or related parameter).
Observes its effect on root behavior.

Varied T₀
Studies the influence of initial temperature T₀ on the system.
Includes detailed plots highlighting trends.

Polytropic Variation
Implements polytropic variations, exploring how specific physical conditions impact the roots.
Provides relevant theoretical and graphical results.

Volumetric Expansion Variation
Analyzes volumetric changes and their role in the system.
Visualizes the correlation between expansion and root behavior.
